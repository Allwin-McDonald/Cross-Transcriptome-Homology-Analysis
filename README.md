Code from Allwin McDonald (Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena)

Purpose of script is to identify close enzyme homologs between species to look for closely related (or not) protein sequences. 

Input files can be .fasta or .txt in fasta format; peptides for query sequence and nucleotides for compared transcripts (I did not originally have access to .pep files for all transcripts, so it was easiest to simply translate myself)

Outputs a list of gene/transcript IDs with closest homology match for each query sequence and the %ID of that match.
